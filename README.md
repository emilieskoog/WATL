# WATL Viral Ecogenomics & Microbial Evolution 
## Analysis & Methods Repository

#### Overview

This repository contains the full analysis workflows, scripts, and methods underlying the viral ecogenomic study of the Western Australian Transient Lakes (WATL) system used in Skoog et al. (2026). The work uses the foundational lake-scale geochemical characterization of Plattner et al. (2026) and adds the metagenomic and viral ecogenomic framework needed to resolve how viral diversity, viral biophysics, and virus-environment interactions across the pH-salinity gradients presented in these acidic and alkaline brines.

##### This repository therefore serves two purposes:

1. Provides a reproducible computational record of all analyses used in the viral ecogenomic manuscript.

2. Serves as a methods companion to the paper, containing pipelines, parameters, and scripts that exceed what can be included in the main text.
